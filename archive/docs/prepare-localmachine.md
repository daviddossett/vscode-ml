# Preparing development environment

Before training deep learning models on your local or remote computer you should make sure you have the latest applicable prerequisites installed. This includes making sure the latest drivers and libraries for your NVIDIA GPU (if you have one). You should also ensure you have installed Python and Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Python support for Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code, and appropriate deep learning frameworks such as Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe2, MXNet, Keras, Theano and/or Chainer.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Software introduction in the following subsectons is excerpted from their homepages.

## NVIDIA GPU driver, CUDA and cuDNN

### NVIDIA GPU driver

Deep learning frameworks take advantage of NVIDIA GPU to let machines learn at a speed, accuracy, and scale towards true artificial intelligence. If your computer has NVIDIA GPU cards, please visit [here](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or try OS update to install the latest driver.

### CUDA

[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA.
It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.
Currently, CUDA Toolkit **9.0** is required by latest version of deep learning frameworks.

To install CUDA

- Visit this [site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive), download CUDA and install it.
- Make sure to install the CUDA runtime libraries, and then add CUDA binary path to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.
- On Windows, this path is "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin" by default.

![install CUDA on Windows](./media/prepare-local-machine/install_cuda90_win.png)

### cuDNN

[cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks by NVIDIA. cuDNN v6 is required by latest deep learning frameworks.

To install cuDNN
- Visit [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive) to download and install v7.0.5 for CUDA 9.0 package.
- Ensure to add the directory containing cuDNN binary to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.
- On Windows, you can copy cudnn64_7.dll to "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin".


## Python

Python has been the primary programming language for deep learning applications.
**64-bit** Python distribution is required, and the latest [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/) is recommended for the best compatibility.

Please add Python directory to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.
You also need to install **pip**, which is the package management system to install and manage software packages written in Python.
Deep learning frameworks rely on pip for their own installation.

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. On Windows, it is preferred to install the Python launcher for yourself only.
> 2. If your Python distribution is installed in the system directory (e.g. the one shipped with Visual Studio 2017), administrative permission is required to install Python packages with pip.

![install Python on Windows](./media/prepare-local-machine/install_python_win.png)

Then, we verify whether Python is installed correctly, and upgrade pip to the latest version.
Suppose Python 3.5 is installed, please execute the following commands in a terminal:

- **Windows**
    ```cmd
    C:\>python -V
    Python 3.5.4

    C:\>pip3 -V
    pip 10.0.1 from c:\users\test\appdata\local\programs\python\python35\lib\site-packages (python 3.5)

    C:\>python -m pip install -U pip
    ```

- **macOS**
    ```bash
    MyMac:~ test$ python3 -V
    Python 3.5.4

    MyMac:~ test$ pip3 -V
    pip 10.0.1 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)

    MyMac:~ test$ python3 -m pip install -U pip
    ```

- **Linux**
    ```bash
    test@MyLinux:~$ python3 -V
    Python 3.5.4

    test@MyLinux:~$ pip3 -V
    pip 10.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages (python 3.5)

    test@MyLinux:~$ sudo python3 -m pip install -U pip
    ```

## Working with Python in Visual Studio Code
Python is fully supported in Visual Studio Code through extensions.
Please visit [Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for more details.

### Setting up the Python interpreter
Users need to specify the proper Python interpreters for AI projects if there are multiple ones.

To set the default Python environment Visual Studio Code, please open the settings by:
* Using menu **File > Preferences > Settings** (CTRL + comma)

or :

* Executing command **Preferences: Open User Settings**

Please add a ***python.pythonPath*** setting which points to your preferred Python interpreter.

**USER SETTINGS** is the global setting while **WORKSPACE SETTINGS** only applies to the current workspace. Workspace setting overwrites the user setting.

![Python setting](media/prepare-local-machine/setting-python-interpreter.png)


>[!TIP]
> A quick way to add this setting is to click the Python environment button on status bar. This changes the workspace setting.

![Python quick setting](media/prepare-local-machine/setting-python-interpreter-quick.png)


## One-click installer
Setting up deep learning and machine learning software as well as their dependencies is not an easy task.
We recommend that you use the [one-click installer](https://github.com/Microsoft/samples-for-ai/#using-a-one-click-installer-to-setup-deep-learning-frameworks)
) to install all of them automatically across Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Inter-operation between ML/DL frameworks via model file conversion

In recent years, machine learning and deep learning become very popular in IT industry.
There have been plenty of frameworks for users to build their own models.
However, they differ with each other greatly on the implementation details.
This will inevitably result in that models produced by one framework cannot be reused for subsequent training or inference in another framework, which brings inconvenience and increases cost to users on framework choice.

Model file conversion is a feasible trial towards resolving this challenge.
In the above subsections, we introduce several model converters: coremltools, onnxmltools, winmltools and tf2onnx, as well as their installation method.

For Windows users, we recommend that you use the [one-click installer](https://github.com/Microsoft/samples-for-ai/#using-a-one-click-installer-to-setup-deep-learning-frameworks) to setup these converters.
If you wish to install them by yourself, first go to the third-party web site to install unofficial [XGBoost](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#xgboost) and [LIBSVM](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#libsvm) 64-bit Windows packages,
and then run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
pip3 install tensorflow==1.5.0 scikit-learn onnx "git+https://github.com/apple/coremltools@v0.8" onnxmltools winmltools "git+https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx.git@r0.1"
```
